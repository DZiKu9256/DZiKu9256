Hi, 
I'm @DZiKu9256, 
I identify online as InfinityMaster24. 
My name is Tomi, I come from Poland 
and I've already 24 years old.

My interests include online computer games, 
I love motoring and recently I have been delving 
deeper into programming. 
My knowledge is unfortunately not very high, 
but I learn very quickly and spend my time on PHP courses.

Since not so long ago, 
I've been trying to play games less 
and spend my time on more productive things. 
I had an idea for a very complex but ambitious project in my head, 
which has the potential to be something more. 
Unfortunately, my possibilities are very limited, 
which limits my development and implementation of the project.

There are a few facts that contribute to 
decently driving me to further trials and tests. 
I try to keep my ambition at a very high level 
so that the whole thing is sufficiently refined, 
plus my creativity, which helped in planning this project.

My project is called "IMTomi" and the website is "IMTomi24". 
The foundations of the website are almost set and 
the main programming language we will use is PHP. 
Thanks to this we will be able to easily manage data 
and dynamically develop our platform in any direction.

• Registration and Login - 
Users will be able to create accounts after prior verification. 
After logging in, they will receive additional site features.
• Online Store - 
We will allow users to browse, purchase products and subscriptions, 
as well as view their purchase history and manage their subscriptions.
• Clicker Game - 
At first, it will be a simple entertainment game with plans for further development.

In terms of time and the development of our skills, 
I plan to create my own blockchain based on Binance Smart Chain, 
which will offer fast and cheap transfers. 
An integral part of the project is a dedicated cryptocurrency wallet 
available exclusively on the IMTomi24 website.

Over time, the clicker game will be transformed into 
a tool for mining one of the two planned cryptocurrencies:
• LittleTomiCoin (LTiC) - a smaller mined unit,
• TomiCoin (TiC) - the main currency that I want to introduce 
in trading on various platforms.

Technologies and Tools:
• In addition to PHP, I plan to use a number 
of other technologies and tools to ensure the highest quality of the project.  
These include JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and MySQL databases. 
• As the project develops, it is very likely that frameworks 
such as Laravel, React, and Symfony 5 will be added, 
as well as integration with DevOps tools such as Docker, 
to streamline the implementation and project management processes. 

Benefits for collaborators: 
• Collaboration on IMTomi24 is a chance to gain 
valuable experience working on a large, ambitious project. 
• I offer the opportunity to develop skills, 
work in a close-knit team and have a real impact 
on shaping the future of the platform. 
• Although the project will be free in the initial stages, 
those involved can count on rewards in the future, 
including potential shares in the project or other forms of remuneration. 

Community and communication: 
• I plan to build an active community around the project. 
We will use the Discord platform for communication 
to facilitate cooperation and the exchange of ideas. 
• We will try to ensure that the project management 
is in line with the Agille methodology, 
which will allow for flexible adaptation to needs and dynamic development. 

Investments and financial support: 
• The store will offer support in the initial stages of the project, 
in the form of subscriptions and one-time purchases. 
• In the longer term, we are considering looking for 
investors or launching a crowdfunding campaign to provide funds 
for further development of the platform. 
• Any form of support will be valuable
and investors can count on a share in the profits and other benefits. 

Openness to ideas: 
• I am open to any ideas and suggestions 
that can contribute to the development of IMTomi24. 
Cooperation with various specialists will help enrich the project 
and make it even more innovative. 

PS. 
If you are interested in participating in this project, 
especially if you have experience in programming or computer graphics, 
I cordially invite you to contact me. The project is at a very early stage of development, 
but perseverance and commitment will be rewarded in the future. 

Best regards, 
Tomi, InfinityMaster24.
