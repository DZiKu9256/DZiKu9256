  Hi, I'm @DZiKu9256, my name is Thomas, I'm from Poland and I'm 23 years old.

  I am interested in computer games, automotive and recently programming. I started working on an application project for Android Studio, graphically and visually it's good, but I don't know enough about Java and other code languages.

  Currently, I am leaving my full-time job to return to a high school to improve my foreign languages and I am planning to study the programmer technician.

  I am looking for a good teacher who will spend some time and help me get on an easier path. of course with mutual assistance for example with your project.
I am competent and a quick learner but 
I don't have the gift to find what I need well. 
I also have a lifetime membership to the Programming Hub app with a really large amount of different programming courses in English.

  You will receive all information about me by writing to me by e-mail: t.brzakala9256@gmail.com 

Regards and thank you for your attention.
